###### Reproducible Analysis in R Workshop at SABERWest 2020 ######
###################################################################

### LEARNING GOALS:
# -	Describe how Git can be used to store and document different
#   versions of a set of files
# -	Build and document a package in R for easy installation
# -	Demonstrate how users can collaborate on the same project using Github
# -	Select and apply the most appropriate tool or set of tools for
#   reproducible data analysis
# -	Integrate useful software tools into an existing analysis pipeline


### AGENDA

### Research Collaboration/Replication ###

# Think of one time when collaboration in a project or
# replication of an existing study was made easier for you and
# one time when it was made more difficult.

# Share your thoughts with a neighbor.


### How We Share Code ###

# In groups, discuss your current system for working with, storing,
# and sharing code that you use for research.

# What are the pros and cons of your systems?

# Outline what improvements you would want to make and how this
# workshop could meet those needs.


### Why Versioning? ###

### Make a Git Repo

### Make and Save Changes

### Revert to Old Versions



### What is a Software Package? ###

# In groups of 3-4, discuss what a software package is and contrast with
# the current workspace. What are the components of a software package?

# What distinguishes a package/library from a set of files like you just created?

# Why would we use packages?


### Making an R Package ###

# NAMESPACE



### User-Friendly Code ###

# If you shared this code with someone else in your research group,
# or another research collaborator in the field, what would they want
# to know to use your code?


### Code Documentation

# Functions



### Using GitHub ###

# Individually reflect how you can share files over the internet.

# What are the pros and cons of each method? 


### Pushing Code to GitHub ###



### Action Plan ###

# Reflect individually on your top three action items for when you revisit
# your data analysis set-up.

# What might be a few practical and realistic changes you can make to
# make things easier or more convenient for you in your research?
